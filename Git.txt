git clone

ls -lart //show all hidden folders

Untrack: no tracking of versions 
Staging area: 

For merging  
goto master with git checkout master
git merge abcBranch

the code changes get merged in, but also all the commits that went into the feature branch

The current branch will be updated to reflect the merge, but the target branch will be completely unaffected. Again, this means that git merge is often used in conjunction with git checkout for selecting the current branch and git branch -d for deleting the obsolete target branch

=========

TO upload your local project on Github

-Go to the project folder
git init 

//make your project into git repository and creates a .git directory in the folder
git add . 

//add all files into staged area. Only files in the staged area can be commited. git add abc.java for a single file
git status 
git commit -m "First"

//with message

-Now create a blank repository on Github. and copy its URL like https://github.com/Ali-Hamza-An5ari/HTML_MarkSheet.git
-Run this to link your project with github repositor. 

git remote add origin https://github.com/Ali-Hamza-An5ari/HTML_MarkSheet.git 

local repository needs to know which repository the remote have to linked. we added remote URL with nick name origin (origin is a standard name) 
git push will not work because we have not defined the default repository branch for the local branch so need to specify maste.

git push origin master

git stash to save uncommited changes in local by removing it from the main code.
