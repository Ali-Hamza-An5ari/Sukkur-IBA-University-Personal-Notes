Untrack: no tracking of versions 
Staging area: 

For merging  
goto master with git checkout master
git merge abcBranch


the code changes get merged in, but also all the commits that went into the feature branch

The current branch will be updated to reflect the merge, but the target branch will be completely unaffected. Again, this means that git merge is often used in conjunction with git checkout for selecting the current branch and git branch -d for deleting the obsolete target branch
